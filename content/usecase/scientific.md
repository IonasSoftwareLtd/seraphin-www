service: Low temperature storage of scientfic research assets
client: Edward Furlong
shortDescription: >
  IoT solutions based on LoRaWAN or NB-IoT/LTE-M have seen widespread adoption
  within scientific industry. One clear-cut requirement is storing high value assets
  in suitable environments such as vaccines or scientific research reagents in low temperature
  freezers.
challenge: >
  Ensure a scientific reserach sample is preserved in a low temperature 
  environment of -80°C. Alert the guardian of the sample if the temperature 
  in the environment starts rising  by the way of sending a SMS and initiating a 
  phone call containing information about the affected asset.
solution: >
  A LoRaWANN sensor installed to monitor the low temperature environment 
  and configured to emit temperature readings at regular time intervals. The sensor
  is onboarded to Seraphin IoT Wireless Monitoring and Telemetry solution and the
  platform has a rule configured that triggers a SMS and phone call alert
  if the temperature reported by the sensor rises above -80°C.

Seraphin IoT Wireless Monitoring and Telemetry platform has been trusted by the scientific community to
monitor high value assets in low temperature environments. The LoRaWAN based networks deployed at 
scientific research laboratories have proved to be extremely reliable, demonstrating robustness 
in often secluded areas and 100% delivery ratios between sensors and LoRaWAN gateways.

An interval-based sensor reading configuration have also proved to be the preferred 
option over immediate, value-change based configuration. Waking-up end nodes once every 15 minutes
to read and emit temperature data ensures the lifespan of a single sensor of around 10 years. 
A temperature rising in a low temperature freezer does so very slowly giving the on-call engineers 
hours to move assets to another working freezers or to repair the one reporting a fault.
