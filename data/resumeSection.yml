      #### Sensor sends data

      The system protects your assets by sending telemetry data from variety of supported sensors to the Seraphin cloud servers. Incoming data is evaluated against user defined rules, which trigger alerts if something is amiss. All sensor-sent telemetry data is stored in the cloud and is available for live and retrospective view via a mobile friendly and secure web portal.

      #### Telemetry event evaluation

      Organisations onboarded onto Serpahin online portal define rules that every incoming telemetry event is evaluated against. The result determines if an alert should be trigerred to an on-call engineer. The portal makes it easy to define and manage any number of rules you may need, browse through the alerts, and stay informed about actions your on-call engineers have taken.

      #### Alert management using online portal

      If rule conditions are met, a notification in the form of email, text message or a phone call is triggered to inform the user about the alert. Our system makes it easy to track the lifetime of each alert, from the moment it was trigerred until it's acknowledged by an on-call engineer.
