  ### IoT Wireless Monitoring and Telemetry platform

  Seraphin Monitoring Platform is a comprehensive IoT software platform developed to provide real-time 
  monitoring and rapid alert capability.


  The system is designed to gather, evaluate and present telemetry data. 

  Incoming data is evaluated against user defined rules. If rule conditions are met, the notification 
  in the form of **email**, **text message** or a **phone call** is triggered to inform the user about alarm condition.


  All sensor-sent telemetry data is stored in the cloud and available for live and retrospective 
  view via a mobile friendly and secure web portal.
