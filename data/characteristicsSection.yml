      #### AWS Cloud-native application
      
      The platform is hosted within the AWS cloud, powered by the same infrastructure as Netflix and government websites.


      The cloud-nativity of a software solution has tremendous impact on the design and quality of the overall solution.
      Cloud native application codebase **ages much slower** than the codebase of a regular application taken into the cloud.

      #### End to end encryption
      
      In LoRaWAN deployments data packets between sensors and gateways are encrypted using **AES** cipher. 
      The gateway communicates with *LoRaWAN Network Server* over **TLS**.
      All LoRaWAN device deployments adopt the security practises descibed in

      [LoRaWAN ™ SECURITY: A White Paper Prepared for the LoRa Alliance™ by Gemalto, Actility, and Semtech](https://lora-alliance.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/lorawan_security_whitepaper.pdf "LoRaWAN Security")

  - subtitle: Multi-tenancy

      #### Data segregation

      The platform is designed to segregate data associated within a single organisation into its own space -
      completely separated from other organisations. This ensures greater security of data reducing likelihood
      of data loss in the event of infrastructure or user error.

  - subtitle: RBAC
    content: >
      #### Role based access control

      Seraphin IoT is designed to support 4 access roles - **User**, **Client**, **Partner** and **Root**.
      While the latter enjoys full access to system across the entire cloud, **Users** are allowed a restricted view 
      and read-only access to data specific to organisation they belong to.
   

resilient:
  - subtitle: Uptime commitment
    content: >
      #### 99.9% Uptime commitment

      Seraphin IoT data ingestion endpoints are highly available services guaranteeing **99.9%** uptime commitment
      which is specifically mentioned in the underlying AWS SLA document.
      
   
  - subtitle: Distributed architecture
    content: >
      #### No single point of failure

      Seraphin IoT data ingestion endpoints, as well as the database the solution uses to store all event data, 
      have been architected to work as a distributed system in a fault-tolerant manner.
 

scalable:
  - subtitle: Platform scalability
    content: >
      #### Vertical and horizontal scaling
 
      Reliability and performance are inherent in the product, ensuring you can expect the platform to scale 
      with predictable performance whether you gather data from a handful or thousands of IoT devices.


      This makes Seraphin IoT platform the ideal solution for startups, large corporations as well as re-sellers thanks
      to the platforms support for **multi-tenancy**.
    
extendible:
  - subtitle: Event push
    content: >
      #### Event-based data feeds

      Seraphin IoT can forward all sensor-received data in an event-push manner to external integration endpoints.
    
  - subtitle: Flexible data formats
    content: >
      #### Text and binary data formats

      The platform can be configured to work with any data format - text or binary, structured or unstructed irrespective
      of whether the data is ingested or emitted to external systems.
